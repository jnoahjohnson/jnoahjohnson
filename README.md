## Writing 
There are two main areas where I publish my writing. The first is [Medium](https://medium.com/@jnoahjohnson) where I mainly focus on consumer technology, productivity, and workflows.

I also have published some technical articles on my [Noah Johnson Dev Blog](https://blog.noahjohnson.dev). Take a look at both locations and let me know what you think!

## Interests
Outside of technology, I love my family. My wife and I just had our first son in 2022. It has been a big adventure for us. Just a couple years ago I had a heart arrythmia so we are very grateful we are where we are now. Here are some of my other interests:
